# Twin-Primes

A twin prime is a pair of prime numbers that have a difference of 2. An example of this would be: (11, 13) or (59, 61).
This program uses matplotlib to plot the 'distribution' of the sets of twin primes. Using sieve of eratosthenes to find the
prime numbers, then using a twin_primes function to list out all the twin primes up to 'n'
