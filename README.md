# Twin-Primes

## About:
A twin prime is a pair of prime numbers that have a difference of 2. An example of this would be: (11, 13) or (59, 61).
This program displays every set of twin primes up to the users input - in this case, PySimpleGUI is used to display the
pairs of twin primes on the left side of the GUI. Meanwhile, a scatter plot is displayed on the right side of
the GUI to show the distribution of the twin primes. Lastly, another .py file is to calculate the twin primes but doing it
through the method of sieve of Eratosthenes.
